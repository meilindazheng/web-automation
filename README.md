Purpose Project : Automatically scrap data of 'Iphone 13' from 2 different E-Commerce

End result : Combination of 2 data sort by price ASC.

Data that should be included :
    - Website Name
    - Product Name
    - Product Price
    - Link
    
Technology used :
    - Jupyter Notebook & Python
    - BeautifulSoup
    - Selenium WebDriver

Note : 
1. I have implemented multiple pages scrapping data, but 98% of the multiple pagination data is not categorized as 'iPhone 13' so I only do scrap to the first page and categorized it based on iPhone 13 tag.
2. At the end of code, I try to implement function to make the link clickable and editing the preview of the link so it is not too long.
